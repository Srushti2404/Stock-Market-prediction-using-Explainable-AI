# 📈 Stock Market Prediction using Explainable AI (XAI)

This project uses **machine learning** techniques and **Explainable AI (XAI)** to predict stock market prices. It not only forecasts future stock prices using models like XGBoost but also explains **why** the model makes those predictions using **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Historical stock data loading and preprocessing
- 🤖 XGBoost Regression Model for stock prediction
- 🔍 Explainable AI with SHAP for model interpretability
- 📈 Evaluation using RMSE and visualization plots

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- XGBoost
- SHAP (Explainable AI)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit (for optional web app visualization)
- yfinance (to fetch stock data)


## 🛠️ How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Srushti2404/Stock-Market-prediction-using-Explainable-AI.git


2. Install dependencies:
   "pip install -r requirements.txt"


4. Run Streamlit App:
 streamlit run app.py


🔍 Explainable AI
We used SHAP to understand the internal decision-making of the model. It helps:

--Identify the impact of features like Open, High, Volume, etc.

-Detect bias and improve trust in AI predictions
